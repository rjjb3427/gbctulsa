			<h3><a href="/ministries/biblical-counseling">Biblical Counseling</a></h3>
			<p>We believe the Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God, which is sufficient for all of life. We have trained and experienced counselors committed to the sufficiency of Scripture in order to offer practical biblical solutions to the problems of life. Biblical counseling is done by Christians who are convinced that God is able to make the changes necessary as His Word is ministered in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/men-of-grace">Men of Grace</a></h3>
			<p>The Men of Grace gather Tuesday mornings at 7:00 or Friday mornings at 6:00 for breakfast and bible study. During this time we discuss Scripture and homework, and are challenged in specific, practical ways to be spiritual- minded men, godly husbands, loving fathers and faithful at our employment. In addition, throughout the week many of the men of GBC gather for personal discipleship in one-on-one mentoring relationships.</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/women-of-grace">Women of Grace</a></h3>
			<p><em>Women of Grace</em> meets at the church on Tuesdays at 9:30-11:30 a.m. or 7:00-9:00 p.m. for in-depth Bible study, lecture, and prayer time. Homework assignments are explored in the dynamic of small discussion groups. The goal of such studies is to encourage older women to instruct younger women to love their husbands, their children, and to be keepers at home as they grow in Christ-like character.</p>

			<p>While <em>Women of Grace</em> meets on Tuesday mornings, <em>Children of Grace</em> (from Nursery to Kindergarten) provides child care and Bible instruction.</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/adult-bible-class">Adult Bible Class</a></h3>
			<p>The adult Bible class meets on Sunday mornings at 9:30 a.m. during the Sunday School hour for an in-depth study and discussion of a portion of Scripture or theological topic.</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/youth-of-grace">Youth of Grace</a></h3>
			<p>Our goal is to train our youth (7th-12th grade) to become mature adults in Christ. GBC Youth are committed to learning the Scripture in a challenging lecture and discussion group format, along with serving the Lord in creative ways.</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/sunday-school">Sunday School</a></h3>
			<p>We believe that children are able to absorb and comprehend the richness of God's Word when skillful and studious teachers labor to carefully explain it to them. We have carefully selected a God-exalting and God-centered curriculum, in contrast to many of the merely entertaining and playful approaches to Sunday School so commonly found today. Lives are not transformed through activities, games, or playful programs, but by the power of God's Word!</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/well-versed-kids">Well-Versed Kids</a></h3>
			<p>Children (ages 4-12) meet each Wednesday night during our mid-week Bible study and prayer meeting. The children are instructed from the Word of God, with an emphasis placed on Scripture memory work and the learning of praise songs.</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/questions-of-grace">Questions of Grace</a></h3>
			<p>Members and friends of GBC are welcome to participate in our open-forum internet discussion group, where theology, recent messages, church practice and any other spiritual issues on your mind are "fair game" for discussion among all!</p>

			<h3><a href="/ministries/homeschoolers-of-grace">Homeschoolers of Grace</a></h3>
			<p><em>Homeschoolers of Grace</em> meet once a month to plan educational activities and field trips in order to help support and encourage homeschooling families. It is a great resource for homeschool curriculum, materials, and assistance. The children can also study together during the Tuesday morning <em>Women of Grace</em> meetings.</p>
