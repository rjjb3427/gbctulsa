	<h2>Biblical Eldership</h2>

	<p>As the apostolic era came to a close, the office of elder became the highest level of local church leadership. An elder is one of a plurality of biblically qualified men who jointly shepherd and oversee a local body of believers.</p>

	<p>The consistent pattern throughout the New Testament is that each local church is shepherded by a plurality of God- ordained elders. Simply stated, this is the only pattern for church leadership given in the New Testament.</p>

	<p>The Scriptures stress the importance of qualified church elders and provides specific standards for evaluating those who would serve in those positions. The qualifications for elders are found in 1 Timothy 3:2-7 and Titus 1:6-8.</p>

	<p>The local church’s structure of government makes a profound statement about the nature of that church and its philosophy of ministry.</p>

	<p>According to the New Testament, elders lead the church, teach and preach the Word, protect the church from false teachers, exhort and admonish the saints in sound doctrine, visit the sick and pray, and judge doctrinal issues. In biblical terminology, elders shepherd, oversee, lead, and care for the local church.</p>

	<p>We are convinced that the elder structure of pastoral leadership best harmonizes with, and promotes the true nature of the local church as revealed in the New Testament. We also believe biblical eldership guards and promotes the preeminence and position of Jesus Christ over the local church.</p>

	<p>It is our conviction that the Lord has provided protection for His church through the government of a plurality of biblically qualified elders. The check and balance that is provided helps to bring about the desired attitude expressed by Peter to the elders:</p>

	<p>“Shepherd the flock of God among you, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock (1 Peter 5:2, 3)."</p>
